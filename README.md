## Patches & Features

* Fork
* Mod, fix
* Test - this is important, so it's not unintentionally broken
* Commit - do not mess with license, todo, version, etc. (if you do change any, bump them into commits of
their own that I can ignore when I pull)
* Pull request - bonus point for topic branches

To ensure your PRs are considered for upstream, you MUST follow the [CakePHP coding standards][standards].
